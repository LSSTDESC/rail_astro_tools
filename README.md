Please consider also inviting the developers as co-authors on publications resulting from your use of RAIL by [making an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail/issues/new/choose).
A convenient list of what to cite may be found under [Citing RAIL](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/citing.html) on ReadTheDocs.
Additionally, several of the codes accessible through the RAIL ecosystem must be cited if used in a publication.

### Citing this package

If you use this package, you should also cite the appropriate papers for each
code used.  A list of such codes is included in the 
[Citing RAIL](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/citing.html)
section of the main RAIL Read The Docs page.
